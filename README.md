### 👋 Hi, I'm Eugene Yan.

I work at the intersection of consumer data & tech to build ML systems **to help customers**. I also write about effective data science, learning, and career **to help readers**. Currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon Kindle helping users read more.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ML & recsys to help readers discover books easier.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more recsys, NLP, and how to [write](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/).
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [`applied-ml`](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml). (Some people collect stamps, I collect these... 😅)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on content and building communities.
- 💬 I'm open to chat about 🚀Effective Data Science, 📚Learning, and 📈Career.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't use the QWERTY keyboard (I use [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) instead).
