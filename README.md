### üëã Hi, I'm Eugene Yan

I design, build, and operate machine learning systems that serve customers at scale. Currently, I'm a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon helping users read more, and get more out of reading. Outside of work, I also...

- [Write](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/), [speak](https://eugeneyan.com/speaking/), and [prototype](https://eugeneyan.com/prototyping/) on ideas in machine learning, RecSys, and LLMs.
- [Curate](https://applyingml.com) papers, guides, and interviews on applying machine learning effectively.
- [Host](https://www.meetup.com/ml-meetups-virtual/) monthly ML meetups and a weekly [LLM reading group](https://lu.ma/llm-paper-club) with practitioners.
- [Send](https://eugeneyan.com/subscribe/) a newsletter about data, ML, and what I'm learning to 6,300+ subscribers.
- In 2024 I'm learning: [Synthetic data](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/synthetic/), [application evals](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/evals/), and scaling ML teams.
- Fun fact: I don't use the QWERTY keyboard (I use [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) instead).
