### 👋 Hi, I'm Eugene Yan

I build recommendation systems and AI-powered experiences that serve customers at scale. Currently, I'm a Principal Applied Scientist at Amazon. Outside of work, I also...

- [Write](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/), [speak](https://eugeneyan.com/speaking/), and [prototype](https://eugeneyan.com/prototyping/) on ideas in machine learning, RecSys, and LLMs.
- Teach how to apply ML/LLMs effectively at [ApplyingML.com](https://applyingml.com) & [Applied-LLMs.org](https://applied-llms.org).
- [Send](https://eugeneyan.com/subscribe/) a newsletter about data, ML, and what I'm learning to 10,000+ subscribers.
- In 2025 I'm learning: [RecSys × LLMs](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/recsys-llm/), [semantic IDs](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/semantic-ids/), [long-context Q&A](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/qa-evals/), and agents.
- Fun fact: I don't use the QWERTY keyboard (I use [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) instead).
